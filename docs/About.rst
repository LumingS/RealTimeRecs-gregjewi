In 2017 the `Great Lakes Water Authority <https://www.glwater.org/>`_ (GLWA) and the `Real-Time Water Systems Lab <http://107.170.79.190/>`_ began a University-Utility partnership to investigate the application of dynamic control of storm water assets within the GLWA combined sewer system.
The initial scope of the project was to develop a decision support dashboard for a study area of the larger GLWA system.
Recommendations provided via the dashboard would be driven by the control routines developed by researchers in the Real-Time Water Systems Lab.
This unique partnership lowers barriers to the application of innovative approaches in the operation of stormwater assets.

To encourage further innovation and application throughout the greater stormwater operator communitiy, **all materials in support of this effort would be shared**.

This documentation is the product of this effort.



Approach
----------
#. **Selection of Study Area**: A subset on the eastside of the GLWA system was chosen to evaluate the benefits of real-time control. The study area includes major control and storage assets such as: Fairview Pump Station, Conner Creek Pump Station, Conner Creek CSO Retention Basin, Conner Creek Forebay and Inline Storage, and Freud Pump Station. In total there are 41 pumps, gates, and valves controlling well over 120 million gallons of storage in the study area.

#. **Gather Evaluation Scenarios**: A collection of precipiation events of varying intensity, duration, and spatial extent were used to evaluate the performance of the control strategies and objectives within the footprint of the study area. These events were derived from both real data taken from precipitation gauges across the GDRSS footprint, design storms, and radar-based products.

#. **Implement Control Strategies**: Different control strategies are actively under development in the Real-Time Water Systems Lab on theoretical stormwater systems. To implement these control strategies on the GDRSS model and in real life, we developed software applications. The applications facilitate the application of the control strategies with both the modeled system and the real-world system.

#. **Evaluate Strategies and Scenarios**: 

#. **Apply Findings to Real-Time Control Engine**:

#. **Build Visualization Tool for Operators**: 

#. **Real-World Evaluation**: Once the Decision-Support Dashboard is in the hands of the stormwater operators we will begin an evaluation and monitoring phase. A description of our monitoring and evaluation plan can be found here: *link here*.

#. **Iterate**: Given feedback, return to experimentation above.
