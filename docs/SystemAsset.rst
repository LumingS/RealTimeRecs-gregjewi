System Assets
=============

The System Assets module was built to support the real-time recommendations for sewer assets of the Great Lakes Water Authority network.
Its primary purpose is to contain the structure for the read/write capabilities with the InfluxDB database for the specific types of assets common in the network.
It also houses many functions used in determining the control recommendations for the assets/system.
