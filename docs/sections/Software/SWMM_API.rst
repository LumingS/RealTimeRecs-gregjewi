SWMM API
========

Hello Work

SWMM API grew out of the desire to store and manipulate various data from EPA SWMM input files (.inp) during the stormwater control experiments.
The SWMM API allows for the parsing of the raw input text file into an array of different dictionaries and data structures exposed to the user.

Future features will allow users to build .inp files from the data structures.
